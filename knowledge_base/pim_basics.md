# Product Information Management (PIM) Basics

## What is PIM?

Product Information Management (PIM) refers to the process of managing all the information required to market and sell products through various distribution channels. A PIM solution provides a central hub to create, maintain, and enrich product information, ensuring accuracy and consistency.

## Core Functions of a PIM System

- **Centralization:** Consolidates product data from various sources (ERP, PLM, supplier data) into a single source of truth.
- **Data Enrichment:** Allows teams to add marketing descriptions, technical specifications, images, videos, and other rich content.
- **Contextualization:** Adapts product information for different channels, regions, and languages.
- **Data Governance:** Establishes workflows, validation rules, and user roles to maintain data quality.
- **Distribution:** Feeds consistent and high-quality product information to all output channels, such as e-commerce websites, mobile apps, print catalogs, and marketplaces.

## Why is PIM Important?

In today's omnichannel landscape, customers expect accurate and detailed product information wherever they shop. PIM systems help businesses deliver a superior customer experience, accelerate time-to-market, and improve operational efficiency by streamlining data management processes.
