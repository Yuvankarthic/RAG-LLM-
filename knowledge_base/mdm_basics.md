# MDM Basics

## What is Master Data Management (MDM)?
Master Data Management (MDM) is a technology-enabled discipline in which business and IT work together to ensure the uniformity, accuracy, stewardship, semantic consistency, and accountability of the enterprise's official shared master data assets.

In simpler terms, MDM is about having one "single source of truth" for critical business data like customers, suppliers, and products.

## Difference between PIM and MDM
- **PIM** focuses specifically on **product** data for marketing and sales (descriptions, images, specs).
- **MDM** is broader and manages **all** master data entities across the organization (customers, employees, suppliers, assets, location, AND products). PIM can be considered a subset of MDM or a specialized system that feeds into MDM.

## What is a Master Record?
A master record (often called a "Golden Record") is the single, authoritative version of a data entity. It is created by consolidating data from various sources and resolving conflicts to ensure accuracy.

## Why Duplicate Records are Bad
- **Confusion**: Sales teams might contact the same customer twice if there are two records.
- **Inaccurate Reporting**: Sales figures or inventory counts will be wrong if the same item is counted multiple times under different names.
- **Wasted Costs**: Mailing marketing materials to the same person multiple times wastes money.
