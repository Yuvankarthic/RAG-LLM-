# Master Data Management (MDM) Basics

## What is MDM?

Master Data Management (MDM) is a comprehensive method of enabling an enterprise to link all of its critical data to one file, called a master file, that provides a common point of reference. MDM is about managing the shared data of an organization, such as customer data, product data, and supplier data.

## Key Differences between PIM and MDM

- **Scope:** MDM is broader and manages master data across multiple domains (customer, supplier, product, location). PIM focuses exclusively on product master data.
- **Purpose:** MDM's goal is to create a single, authoritative source of truth for all enterprise master data to improve operational efficiency and analytics. PIM's primary goal is to enrich and deliver product information to sales and marketing channels.
- **Users:** MDM is typically used by data stewards, IT teams, and business analysts. PIM is primarily used by marketing teams, e-commerce managers, and product managers.

## How PIM and MDM Work Together

MDM and PIM are complementary disciplines. An MDM system can feed a PIM system with clean, governed, and standardized core product data. The PIM system then takes this master data and enriches it with the marketing- and sales-specific information needed for omnichannel commerce. For many organizations, the MDM system acts as the system of record, while the PIM acts as the system of engagement.
