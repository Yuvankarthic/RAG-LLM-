# Attributes

## What is an Attribute?
An attribute is a specific characteristic or detail that describes a product. It helps define what the product is and allows customers to search for and filter products.

## Mandatory vs Optional Attributes
- **Mandatory Attributes**: These are details that **must** be present for every product. Without them, the product cannot be created or sold.
  - *Examples*: SKU, Product Name, Price.
- **Optional Attributes**: These details provide extra information but are not strictly required to list the product.
  - *Examples*: Care Instructions, Video URL, SEO Keywords.

## Category-Specific Attributes (Example: Apparel)
Some attributes only make sense for certain types of products. For **Apparel**, specific attributes might include:
- **Fabric Type** (e.g., Cotton, Polyester)
- **Fit** (e.g., Slim, Regular, Loose)
- **Pattern** (e.g., Solid, Striped, Checked)
- **Neckline** (e.g., V-neck, Round neck)

These attributes would not be relevant for a product like a *Toaster*.
