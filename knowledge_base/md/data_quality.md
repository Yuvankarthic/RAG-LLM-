# Data Quality

## What Product Data Quality Means
Data quality refers to the condition of a set of values of qualitative or quantitative variables. In PIM/MDM, high-quality data means the product information is:
- **Accurate**: Describes the product correctly.
- **Complete**: Has all necessary attributes filled in.
- **Consistent**: Uses standard formats (e.g., all weights in "kg").
- **Timely**: Is up-to-date.

## Common Issues
- **Missing Values**: Important fields like "Brand" or "Color" are left blank.
- **Duplicates**: The same product exists twice with slightly different names (e.g., "iPhone 13" and "Apple iPhone 13").
- **Wrong Units**: One product uses "pounds" while another uses "kilograms" without specification.
- **Typos**: "Blck" instead of "Black".

## Why Data Quality Matters for Business
- **Customer Trust**: Accurate data prevents returns due to wrong product descriptions.
- **Searchability**: Good data ensures products show up when customers search for them.
- **Brand Reputation**: Poor data (like typos or missing images) makes a brand look unprofessional.
