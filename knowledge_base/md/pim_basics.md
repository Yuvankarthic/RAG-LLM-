# PIM Basics

## What is Product Information Management (PIM)?
Product Information Management (PIM) is a system used to manage all the data, content, and other materials that are needed to market and sell products. It acts as a central repository for product information, ensuring that data is accurate, consistent, and up-to-date across all sales channels.

## Why PIM is needed
- **Centralization**: Keeps all product data in one place rather than scattered across spreadsheets and emails.
- **Consistency**: Ensures the same product details (like description, price, and specs) appear on your website, mobile app, and printed catalogs.
- **Efficiency**: Reduces time-to-market by making it easier to update and distribute product information.

## Simple Example of Product Attributes
Imagine you are selling a **T-shirt**. PIM would manage attributes such as:
- **SKU**: TSHIRT-001
- **Name**: Cotton Crew Neck T-Shirt
- **Color**: Blue
- **Size**: Large
- **Material**: 100% Cotton
- **Price**: $19.99
- **Description**: A comfortable, breathable cotton t-shirt perfect for everyday wear.
